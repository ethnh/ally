# Localisation
### Goals:

- 


Get a list of all cities in the world via https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/185793/is-there-a-way-to-retrieve-all-cities-in-the-world-from-openstreetmap
OR https://download.gisgraphy.com/
OR https://osmcode.org/pyosmium/

count number of cities before continuing:

see https://demo.fleaflet.dev/many_markers
see https://demo.fleaflet.dev/circle
see https://demo.fleaflet.dev/many_circles

then, via https://demo.fleaflet.dev/many_markers
OR https://github.com/fleaflet/flutter_map/blob/master/example/lib/pages/many_circles.dart

create clickable nodes on every city in the world (maybe filter to spoken language regions by device language if GPS not possible), geolocate the user or let the user locate their own 
allow user to claim city to Ally staff via ID verif (point of centralization), allow govt entities to claim cities via multi-factor-verif,
if govt, pin their user to the top, otherwise sort by popularity - bonus of centralization
