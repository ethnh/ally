##### MOTD

Stand on the shoulders of giants.

Privacy is a fundamental human right.

Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right.

Bodily autonomy is a fundamental human right.

In a world of global markets, the ability to manage currency transcends borders and is a fundamental right for all.

The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.

You are about to reach your goals.

Your potential is limitless, and every day brings you closer to your dreams.

You are the architect of your life; each decision builds your future.

Speak clearly: think clearly.

They are watching. We have known for a long time. We must protect our privacy.

Be very wary of using someone else's computer.

You never change things by fighting against the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the old model obsolete.
