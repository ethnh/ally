# Development Notes & Considerations
## User connections
https://ally.lol/graphexample/ - something like this or:
TODO: make d3 example with 16x16 profile pics

## Ally-NG
Ally will soon support an integration in the editor with "AI writing" based on:
Ally-NG: Next Generation of note taking - 'Always on' Keylogger & 'optionally on' speech to text ai model - More insights into your computing usage than ever before.  or subscription for "premium" AI (business model)
An extra bonus of Ally-NG is higher availability of your posted content
Open Source for trust
end goal of your own AI that writes like you do
### Curation?
With an Ally-NG backend for compute resources, running an AI model to search, evaluate, sort, and serve personalized, private, and fully customizable recommendations.
### Business model?
Standalone - possible business for parents interested into insights on children's computer activities or consulting for business owners interested in monitoring employee computer activity, and what they hear and say
Premium AI model may also soon be able to analyze screenshots taken at arbitrary intervals for a ongoing fee
### Ally-NG context
I've been using a prototype of Ally-NG for a few months now, so it would just be an issue of integration & release (only avail macos, win, & linux & platforms supporting https://github.com/Vaibhavs10/insanely-fast-whisper)

## Translation, Ally-NG backends
also worth consider:
Integration of a translation model could allow for internationalization of all text posts
use ally-ng as [text-to-text AI-translation engine?](https://github.com/facebookresearch/seamless_communication) 
[Automatic Speech Recognition?](https://github.com/flashlight/flashlight/tree/main/flashlight/app/asr)

## Localisation
See localisation.md
With localisation, users can expect their 'followed' to be within a certain region
With [flutter_map](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map)
See events from govt agencies, organizations, people you follow, visualized on a map
Why a map?
